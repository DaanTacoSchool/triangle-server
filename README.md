This repository contains the full code required to run the Triangle Server.

This application is created for an assignment from [Avans Hogeschool Breda](http://www.avans.nl/).

Triangle Server is a server that can receive fragments of data (any kind) and send it to other clients.

Features
=======

 - [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx) and [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) used.
 - WebAPI and [WebSockets](https://github.com/aspnet/WebSockets) to receive incoming fragments of data.
 - [WebSockets](https://github.com/aspnet/WebSockets) is also used for sending the data to other clients.
 - [BouncyCastle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BouncyCastle/) used for generating a signed hash of the data and comparing this with the previous received hash.
